    <p>The last thing that I am working on is my art. My Atelier studio, had to
    cancel classes for the rest of the school year. Which made me super sad, but it
  was necessary for the safety of our class. It was a class that I was spending close
to $100 per week for sessions so I redirected some of those funds and finally bought a large
drawing tablet. It is a Huion GT-191 (19 inch display), its a model that's a couple
years old and I bought it used. It should be here Monday or Tuesday, and I'm looking forward
to it. I find that during these trying times, it's important to keep yourself busy and have
things to look forward to. </p>
