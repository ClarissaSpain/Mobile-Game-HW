    <p>I am fortunate to still be working in these trying times. I live in
      this constant state of being grateful to work but also being scared to go to
      work. We have recently been able to transfer most of our workers remotely,
      there are some things that have to be done in person in IT though. I just can't work
      on someone's computer when I'm at home. I also feel responsible as the supervisor
      at Griztech to be the person to continue attending work rl. On the bright side
      not many people are still at work. And we have set up a safe distance room where
      clients can drop off and pick up their laptop without us having to be near them.
      I am taking everything one day at a time and I have been creating small goals
      to look foward to after I get done with my work day. My work hours per week have
      also increased immensely, I used to work 20-25 hours and now I am working 32-35
      hours per week.</p>
